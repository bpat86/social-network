# Social Network
This is a basic social networking site built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Installation

### Step 1.

> Must have Node.js installed as a prerequisite, obvi.

Begin by changing keys.example.js to keys.js and adding in your own secret API keys

## Step 2.

Well, there is no step 2 yet as I'm still working on the React front-end. Cheers 🍻
